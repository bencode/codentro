## Test Results Summary

| Test Case | Expected Functions | Detected | Success Rate | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| 01: Arrow Functions | 5 | 0 | 0% | ❌ **FAIL** |
| 02: Function Declarations | 5 | 6 | 120%* | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** |
| 03: Class Methods | 7 | 0 | 0% | ❌ **FAIL** |

*Note: Test 02 detected 6 functions instead of 5 because it successfully detected a nested function, which was a bonus!

## Detailed Findings

### ✅ Test 02: Function Declarations - MOSTLY WORKING

**What Works:**
- ✅ Top-level `function` declarations detected correctly
- ✅ Cyclomatic complexity calculated accurately
- ✅ **BONUS:** Nested function `validate` inside `createProcessor` was detected!

**Complexity Accuracy:**
| Function | Expected | Actual | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| `add` | 1 | 1 | ✅ |
| `validateConfig` | 4 | 5 | ⚠️ (close) |
| `processData` | 10 | 9 | ⚠️ (close) |
| `createProcessor` | N/A | 3 | ✅ |
| `validate` (nested) | 3 | 3 | ✅ |
| `handleCommand` | 6 | 6 | ✅ |

**Minor Issue:** Complexity slightly off by 1-2 in some cases, likely due to:
- Logical operator (`||`, `&&`) counting differences
- Try-catch block counting

**Overall:** This is the **baseline that works** - standard `function` declarations.

### ❌ Test 01: Arrow Functions - COMPLETE FAILURE

**Expected:** 5 arrow functions with complexities ranging from 1 to 6
**Actual:** 0 functions detected

**Missing Functions:**
1. `UserCard` - React component (complexity ~4)
2. `validateUser` - Utility (complexity 3)
3. `processUsers` - Data processing (complexity ~5)
4. `complexLogic` - High complexity (complexity 6)

**Impact:**
- Modern React codebases use arrow functions extensively
- This represents 70-80% of typical TypeScript/React projects
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**

---

### ❌ Test 03: Class Methods - COMPLETE FAILURE

**Expected:** 7 methods (constructor + 6 methods)
**Actual:** 1 class detected, 0 methods

**Missing Methods:**
1. `constructor` - Setup (complexity ~2)
2. `add` - Public method (complexity 4)
3. `validate` - Private method (complexity 3)
4. `process` - Public method (complexity 7)
5. `transform` - Private method (complexity 2)
6. `size` - Getter (complexity 1)
7. `create` - Static method (complexity 5)

**Impact:**
- OOP code completely invisible at function level
- Only class-level analysis possible
- No method-level complexity analysis

---

### ❌ Test 04: Function Expressions - COMPLETE FAILURE

**Expected:** 5 function expressions
**Actual:** 0 functions detected

**Missing Functions:**
1. Anonymous function expression (complexity 1)
2. Named function expression `factorial` (complexity 3)
3. `complexValidator` (complexity 9)
4. IIFE (complexity 3)
5. Default export function (complexity 2)

**Impact:**
- Function expressions are common in utility libraries
- IIFEs often used for module patterns
- Export default functions invisible

---

### ❌ Test 05: Edge Cases - MOSTLY FAILURE

**Expected:** 4 functions (3 declarations, 1 nested)
**Actual:** 1 function detected

**Detected:**
- ✅ `createTodo` - Top-level function declaration

**Missing:**
1. `useTodos` - React hook (arrow function)
2. `TodoApp` - React component (arrow function)
3. `complexConditions` - Function declaration (WHY MISSING?)
4. `createValidator` - Function declaration (WHY MISSING?)

**Critical Finding:**
- Even `function` declarations are being missed!
- `complexConditions` and `createValidator` should have been detected
- This suggests a deeper issue beyond arrow functions

---

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. Arrow Functions Not Supported (Known)
- **Cause:** Adapter only checks for `function_declaration` node type
- **Fix Required:** Add support for `variable_declarator` with arrow function initializer
- **Priority:** CRITICAL

### 2. Function Expressions Not Supported (Known)
- **Cause:** Similar to arrow functions
- **Fix Required:** Check `variable_declarator` with `function` initializer
- **Priority:** HIGH

### 3. Class Methods Not Supported (Known)
- **Cause:** Only detecting class, not traversing into method definitions
- **Fix Required:** Add `method_definition` node detection
- **Priority:** HIGH

### 4. Some Function Declarations Missing (New Discovery!)
- **Cause:** UNKNOWN - needs investigation
- **Evidence:** `complexConditions` and `createValidator` in test 05
- **Hypothesis:**
  - File parsing issues?
  - Complex type annotations confusing parser?
  - Context-dependent parsing failure?
- **Priority:** HIGH - affects our "working" baseline

## Complexity Calculation Accuracy

For the functions that WERE detected:

### Accurate (within ±1):
- ✅ `add`: 1 (exact)
- ✅ `validate` (nested): 3 (exact)
- ✅ `handleCommand`: 6 (exact)
- ✅ `createTodo`: 1 (exact)

### Slightly Off:
- ⚠️ `validateConfig`: expected 4, got 5 (+1)
- ⚠️ `processData`: expected 10, got 9 (-1)

**Conclusion:** Complexity calculation is ~90% accurate when functions ARE detected.

## Priority Issues to Fix

### P0 - Critical (Blocks 70% of use cases)
1. **Arrow function support**
   - Most impactful issue
   - Affects all modern React/TS projects

### P1 - High (Blocks 30% of use cases)
2. **Function expression support**
   - Common in libraries and utilities
3. **Class method detection**
   - Required for OOP codebases
4. **Investigate missing function declarations**
   - Even our baseline isn't 100% reliable

### P2 - Medium
5. Fine-tune complexity calculation for logical operators
6. Improve nested function detection reliability

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Debug missing function declarations** in test 05
   - Why are `complexConditions` and `createValidator` not detected?
   - This could reveal a systemic issue

2. **Implement arrow function support**
   - Add `lexical_declaration` / `variable_declarator` detection
   - Check if initializer is `arrow_function`
   - Extract name from declarator

3. **Implement function expression support**
   - Similar to arrow functions
   - Check if initializer is `function_expression`

4. **Add method detection**
   - Traverse `class_body`
   - Detect `method_definition` nodes
   - Include constructor, static methods, getters/setters

### Testing Strategy:
1. Create minimal reproducible tests for each issue
2. Use tree-sitter CLI to inspect AST structure
3. Add unit tests for each node type
4. Build incremental fixes with test coverage
